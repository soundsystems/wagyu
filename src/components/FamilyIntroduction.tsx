                For over 20 years, Dustin, Denise, Sawyer, and Kenley Smith have
                put animal well-being firstâ€”raising cattle with care to deliver
                steaks that exceed expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started with grit and stewardship has grown into a full
                cattle operation, then a commercial beef business, and
                eventually Ozark Natural Steak Co.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe great beef starts with stewardship, low-stress
                handling, clean feed, and the patience to do it right. Every
                decision is made with the animals&apos; well-being in mind.
